# Market.io Application

Market.io is an e-commerce website that is built on Node.js and React.

## Motivation

I built this web application while learning Node.js and React as a junior MERN stack developer, I've had a lot of issues which were finally solved.

Version one was my first try until I knew some of my planned ideas couldn't be done easily with Handlebars so I hit React route to do those ideas in version 2.

The app isn't finished yet, it lacks some many features I already planned for before this release. They're all coming to shape up on the next minor update.
