# Market.io Application

Market.io is an e-commerce website that is built on Node.js, simple yet powerful.

## Motivation

I build this app after a long time spent on confusing websites. Market.io is easy, fast and efficient. Now the application is in development so if you're not a developer you can wait us, but if you are one you can pull and play with the project, use our API or try to have fun with us come on it's an open source!
